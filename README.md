# Peer-graded Assignment: Bash, Make, Git, and GitHub
This is a simple game where the player has to guess the total number of files present in the working directory
If the player guesses wrong then the program informs the player whether his guess was greater or smaller than the actual value
If the player gets it right, the program will congratulate the player and the game will end
It consists of three files - ***guessinggame.sh***, a ***makefile*** and this ***README*** file
This README file was generated automatically using the makefile
The main code is of this much lines -

This makefile was run at

Please note that I worked on this project in a Linux virtual machine and a windows machine so there might be some missing tab that would give errors in the makefile.

There might be a slight difference as I am editing this makefile in my Windows machine

I have tried my best to eliminate all errors , but I am warning just in case if I missed something.
Please check using this command - ***cat -e -t -v makefile_name*** and rectify according to your machine if needed.
 
## Instructions to run the program -
1. First run the makefile using - ***make README***
2. Now run the main shell file using - ***bash guessinggame.sh***
